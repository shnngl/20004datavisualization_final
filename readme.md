This project demonstrates interactive visualizations using Streamlit.

# Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates interactive visualizations using Streamlit.  
The goal is to explore trends and patterns in the dataset, providing insights through a combination of different visualization techniques.

## Data Management
### Data Source
- [Link to dataset](https://your-dataset-link.com)  

### Data Cleaning
- Outliers were removed using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.  
- Missing values were handled using interpolation.  

### Sampling Methodology
- A stratified sampling method was applied to balance data distribution.  

---

## Methodology
### Why These Visualization Techniques?
1. **Line chart** â€“ To show trends over time.  
2. **Scatter plot** â€“ To reveal correlations between variables.  
3. **Interactive elements** â€“ Hover and zoom functions enhance data exploration.

## Visualizations
Below are examples of the visualizations generated from the data:

### 1. Trend Over Time
- Line chart showing how the values change over time.

### 2. Correlation Between Variables
- Scatter plot demonstrating the correlation between variables.

## Critical Analysis
### Limitations:
- The dataset is limited in size, which may reduce predictive accuracy.  
- Possible bias in the data collection process.  

### Future Improvements:
- Incorporate additional data sources to increase dataset size.  
- Use more advanced machine learning models to improve predictions.

## Extra Credit: Interactive Dashboard
This interactive dashboard includes multiple visualization types and user controls (e.g., zoom, hover, and filter).  
This enhances the user's ability to explore data dynamically.
